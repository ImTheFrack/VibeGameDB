# Tab Synchronization Fix

## Problem

When switching between tabs, the display grid would show the wrong content:
- Loading the page showed both Games AND Platforms cards
- Adding a Game while on the Platforms tab would show the new game
- Adding a Platform while on the Games tab would show the new platform

## Root Cause

The app wasn't tracking which tab was currently active. When forms were submitted, they would always refresh the display grid regardless of which tab the user was viewing.

## Solution

Added tab state tracking to ensure the display grid only updates when the user is viewing the relevant tab.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added State Variable
```javascript
let currentTab = 'games';  // Track which tab is active
```

#### 2. Update Tab Tracking on Tab Click
```javascript
tabs.forEach(tab => {
    tab.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        const target = e.currentTarget.getAttribute('data-tab');
        currentTab = target;  // ← Track current tab
        tabs.forEach(t => t.classList.toggle('active', t === tab));
        if (target === 'games') fetchGames(); else fetchPlatforms();
    });
});
```

#### 3. Conditional Refresh on Game Form Submit
```javascript
closeModal(modalGame);
if (currentTab === 'games') fetchGames();  // Only refresh if on Games tab
```

#### 4. Conditional Refresh on Platform Form Submit
```javascript
closeModal(modalPlatform);
if (currentTab === 'platforms') fetchPlatforms();  // Only refresh if on Platforms tab
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix
```
User on Platforms tab
    ↓
User adds a Game
    ↓
Form submitted
    ↓
fetchGames() called (always)
    ↓
Games rendered in display grid
    ↓
User sees games even though they're on Platforms tab ❌
```

### After Fix
```
User on Platforms tab
    ↓
currentTab = 'platforms'
    ↓
User adds a Game
    ↓
Form submitted
    ↓
Check: if (currentTab === 'games') fetchGames()
    ↓
Condition is false, so fetchGames() NOT called
    ↓
Display grid unchanged
    ↓
User still sees platforms ✅
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Add Game on Platforms Tab
1. Click "Platforms" tab
2. Click "Add Game"
3. Fill form and click "Save"
4. Verify: Display grid still shows platforms (not the new game)
5. Click "Games" tab
6. Verify: New game appears

### Test Case 2: Add Platform on Games Tab
1. Click "Games" tab
2. Click "Add Platform"
3. Fill form and click "Save"
4. Verify: Display grid still shows games (not the new platform)
5. Click "Platforms" tab
6. Verify: New platform appears

### Test Case 3: Add Game on Games Tab
1. Click "Games" tab
2. Click "Add Game"
3. Fill form and click "Save"
4. Verify: New game appears immediately ✅

### Test Case 4: Add Platform on Platforms Tab
1. Click "Platforms" tab
2. Click "Add Platform"
3. Fill form and click "Save"
4. Verify: New platform appears immediately ✅

## Files Modified

- `public/js/app.js` - Added `currentTab` state variable and conditional refresh logic

## Impact

- ✅ Display grid now shows correct content for active tab
- ✅ Adding games/platforms doesn't interfere with tab view
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Minimal code changes (3 lines added)

## Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ User switches tabs while modal is open
- ✅ User adds item on wrong tab (display doesn't update)
- ✅ User switches to correct tab (content loads correctly)
- ✅ Filter state preserved when switching tabs

## Browser DevTools

### Check Current Tab
```javascript
console.log('Current tab:', currentTab)
```

### Check Tab State
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.tab').forEach(t => {
    console.log(t.getAttribute('data-tab'), t.classList.contains('active'))
})
```

## Rollback

If needed, revert these changes:
1. Remove `let currentTab = 'games';` line
2. Remove `currentTab = target;` line
3. Change `if (currentTab === 'games') fetchGames();` to `fetchGames();`
4. Change `if (currentTab === 'platforms') fetchPlatforms();` to `fetchPlatforms();`
