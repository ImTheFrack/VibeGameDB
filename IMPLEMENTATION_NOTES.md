# Frontend CRUD Wiring - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Frontend Modal Management** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ Added `openModal()` and `closeModal()` functions to show/hide modals
- ✅ Wired close buttons (`[data-close]`) to close their parent modal
- ✅ Added click-outside-to-close behavior for modals
- ✅ Connected "Add Game" button to open game form modal
- ✅ Connected "Add Platform" button to open platform form modal
- ✅ Connected "Import CSV" button to open import modal

### 2. **Game Form Submission** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ Form submission handler for `#form-game`
- ✅ Collects form data: title, description, cover_image_url, trailer_url, platforms
- ✅ Sends POST request to `/plugins/database_handler/games` for new games
- ✅ Sends PUT request to `/plugins/database_handler/games/<id>` for updates
- ✅ Closes modal and refreshes game list on success
- ✅ Shows error alerts on failure

### 3. **Platform Form Submission** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ Form submission handler for `#form-platform`
- ✅ Collects form data: name, type, description, icon_url
- ✅ Sends POST request to `/plugins/database_handler/platforms` for new platforms
- ✅ Sends PUT request to `/plugins/database_handler/platforms/<id>` for updates
- ✅ Closes modal and refreshes platform list on success
- ✅ Shows error alerts on failure

### 4. **Platform Dropdown Population** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ Added `populatePlatformsDropdown()` function
- ✅ Fetches platforms from backend and populates the multi-select in game form
- ✅ Called automatically when "Add Game" button is clicked

### 5. **Backend Platform CRUD** (`handlers/database_handler.py`)
- ✅ Added `_create_platform()` - POST support for platforms
- ✅ Added `_update_platform()` - PUT/PATCH support for platforms
- ✅ Added `_delete_platform()` - DELETE support for platforms
- ✅ Updated `handle()` function to route platform POST/PUT/DELETE requests
- ✅ Platform IDs are auto-generated from platform names (lowercase, underscores)

### 6. **Rendering Improvements** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ Fixed `renderGames()` to handle response structure correctly
- ✅ Fixed `renderPlatforms()` to handle response structure correctly
- ✅ Added fallback images (local SVG placeholders) instead of external URLs
- ✅ Added `onerror` handlers to gracefully handle missing images

## API Endpoints Now Supported

### Games
- `GET /plugins/database_handler/games` - List all games
- `POST /plugins/database_handler/games` - Create a new game
- `PUT /plugins/database_handler/games/<id>` - Update a game
- `DELETE /plugins/database_handler/games/<id>` - Delete a game

### Platforms
- `GET /plugins/database_handler/platforms` - List all platforms
- `POST /plugins/database_handler/platforms` - Create a new platform ✨ NEW
- `PUT /plugins/database_handler/platforms/<id>` - Update a platform ✨ NEW
- `DELETE /plugins/database_handler/platforms/<id>` - Delete a platform ✨ NEW

## How to Test

1. **Start the server:**
   ```powershell
   $env:HOST = '0.0.0.0'
   $env:PORT = '5000'
   python .\main.py
   ```

2. **Open the app:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

3. **Test Add Platform:**
   - Click "Add Platform" button
   - Fill in: Name (e.g., "Steam"), Type (Digital/Physical), Icon URL (optional)
   - Click "Save"
   - Platform should appear in the Platforms tab

4. **Test Add Game:**
   - Click "Add Game" button
   - Fill in: Title, Description, Cover Image URL, Trailer URL
   - Select one or more platforms from the dropdown
   - Click "Save"
   - Game should appear in the Games tab

5. **Test Edit:**
   - Click "Edit" button on any card
   - Modal should open with current data (TODO: implement edit mode)
   - Make changes and save

## Known Limitations / TODO

- Edit functionality is stubbed (clicking Edit logs to console, doesn't open modal with data)
- No validation on image URLs (will show broken image if URL is invalid)
- No loading states or spinners during API calls
- No undo/redo functionality
- Platform count on platform cards not yet implemented
- Search/filter not yet implemented
- Bulk operations not yet implemented

## Files Modified

1. `public/js/app.js` - Added modal management, form handlers, API calls
2. `handlers/database_handler.py` - Added platform CRUD functions and routing
3. `public/css/style.css` - No changes (modal styles already present)
4. `public/index.html` - No changes (modal HTML already present)

## Next Steps

1. Implement edit mode (populate form with existing data when editing)
2. Add loading states and error handling UI
3. Implement Browse & Filter (sorting, filtering, pagination)
4. Implement Search & Autocomplete
5. Update database schema to match README (add junction tables, timestamps, etc.)
